This package is a **General Central Orchestration Brain-Mesh System** designed for building and hosting self-evolving, autonomous AI entities within isolated container environments. It represents an AI deeply integrated into a **ROS 2 environment**, leveraging the full power of the ROS 2 ecosystem (topics, services, and parameters) for real-world interaction and self-monitoring.

**The Central Nervous System of the Bob ROS Ecosystem.**

`bob_central` provides the essential infrastructure for orchestrating complex, multi-modular AI agents in a ROS 2 environment. It handles everything from high-level decision making (Orchestrator) to real-time system visualization (nviz), stateful code engineering (REPL), and autonomous documentation management (Knowledge Graph).

## Core Concept
At its heart, `bob_central` manages a "Brain-Mesh" of interconnected specialized nodes. The system is not monolithic; it is a distributed network of intelligence where every component is replaceable and extensible.

## Key Features
- **Recursive Reasoning (RLM Core)**: Multi-step internal dialogue using expert personas (Architect, Critic, Planner, Debugger) to decompose complex tasks.
- **Persistent Python REPL**: A stateful engineering environment for iterative code development and system manipulation, preserving state across sessions.
- **Centralized Orchestration**: A powerful node that manages conversation flows, busy-locking, and tool calls.
- **Visual Telemetry (nviz)**: High-performance, event-driven dashboard rendering (8-bit grayscale bitmaps) with real-time status indicators.
- **Autonomous Knowledge Graph**: On-demand technical documentation fetching and indexing for AI context.
- **Self-Evolution Framework**: Pure ROS 2 native infrastructure for agents to modify and expand their own capabilities.

## Recursive Thought (RLM)
The **Recursive Language Model** core enables Eva to use the `perform_thought` tool to consult internal specialists before executing sensitive actions.

## Persistent Engineering (REPL)
The `repl_kernel` skill provides Eva with a permanent engineering workspace. 
*   **Persistent State**: Variables, imports, and function definitions persist as long as the stack is running.
*   **Safety**: Isolated execution via a dedicated `repl_node` with 15s timeouts and capture of all stdout/stderr output.

## Ecosystem Management
### The Docker Ecosystem
To manage the complex set of services, a master management script is provided in the `docker/` directory.

**Quick Management:**
```bash
./docker/manage.sh up      # Start the entire ecosystem
./docker/manage.sh down    # Stop all services
./docker/manage.sh build   # Rebuild local images
```
